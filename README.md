# React BaseButton example
This is an example on how to make a BaseButton component in React. It comes with styles that resets browser specific styles on buttons, so that you have a blank button that can be styled however you want, and it will _probably_ look the same in different browsers. I took some time and looked into this but at the moment it's not fresh in memory and I may have missed something.

## Installation
No installation. There's probably a bunch of BaseButton components out there you can use. This one is copy/paste. Have fun!

## Dependencies
`react` and `@emotion/core`, if you're using super old versions I can't say if it will work or not. Feel free to convert it to `styled-components` or something else if you want.
